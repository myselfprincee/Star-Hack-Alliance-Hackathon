        question: "What’s the difference between a meteoroid, a meteor, and a meteorite?",
        answer: `**Meteoroids**: These rocks still are in space. Meteoroids range in size from dust grains to small asteroids.

**Meteors**: When meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere (or that of another planet, like Mars) at high speed and burn up, the fireballs or “shooting stars” are called meteors.

**Meteorites**: When a meteoroid survives a trip through the atmosphere and hits the ground, it’s called a meteorite.

        question: "What is a Meteor Shower?",
        answer: `Scientists estimate that about 48.5 tons (44 tonnes or 44,000 kilograms) of meteoritic material falls on Earth each day. Almost all the material is vaporized in Earth's atmosphere, leaving a bright trail fondly called "shooting stars."

Several meteors per hour can usually be seen on any given night. Sometimes the number increases dramatically—these events are called meteor showers.

Meteor showers occur annually or at regular intervals as the Earth passes through the trail of dusty debris left by a comet. Meteor showers are usually named after a star or constellation that is close to where the meteors appear in the sky. Perhaps the most famous are the Perseids, which peak in August every year. Every Perseid meteor is a tiny piece of the comet Swift-Tuttle, which swings by the Sun every 135 years.

        answer: `
        
The **Hubble Space Telescope** is a large space telescope launched in 1990. It orbits Earth outside the atmosphere, providing clear images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and other cosmic phenomena without atmospheric distortion.

Hubble has contributed significantly to our understanding of the universe, including the discovery of the rate of expansion of the universe and the presence of dark energy.

        answer: `
        
The **phases of the Moon** are caused by the changing angle of the Moon's illumination as seen from Earth. This change occurs because the Moon orbits Earth, and the amount of sunlight reflecting off its surface varies.

The main phases are New Moon, First Quarter, Full Moon, and Last Quarter.

A **black hole** is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. Black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that have ended their life cycles.

They are detected by observing the effects of their strong gravitational pull on nearby stars and gas.

The **Kuiper Belt** is a region of the solar system beyond Neptune, filled with small icy bodies and dwarf planets, including Pluto. It is similar to the asteroid belt but far larger and more distant from the Sun.

The Kuiper Belt is believed to be the source of many comets and other small solar system bodies.

        question: "How does the Sun produce energy?",
        answer: `
        
The Sun produces energy through a process called **nuclear fusion**. In its core, hydrogen atoms fuse together under extreme pressure and temperature to form helium, releasing energy in the form of light and heat.

This energy radiates outward and provides the warmth and light necessary for life on Earth.

Beyond this observable region, the universe may continue, but it is beyond our current observational capabilities.

Although dark matter has not been directly observed, its presence is inferred from its influence on the motion of galaxies and other cosmic structures.

A **supernova** is a powerful explosion that occurs when a star reaches the end of its life cycle. This event results in the star's outer layers being expelled into space, leaving behind a dense core or possibly collapsing into a black hole.

Supernovae are critical for dispersing elements into space, enriching the interstellar medium.

        answer: `More than 50,000 meteorites have been found on Earth.

Of these, 99.8% come from asteroids. The remaining small fraction (0.2%) of meteorites is split roughly equally between meteorites from Mars and the Moon. The over 60 known Martian meteorites were blasted off Mars by meteoroid impacts. All are igneous rocks crystallized from magma. The rocks are very much like Earth rocks with some distinctive compositions that indicate Martian origin.

Several meteors per hour can usually be seen on any given night. Sometimes the number increases dramatically—these events are called meteor showers.

        question: "What is Heliosphere",
        answer: `

The **heliosphere** is a large, bubble-like region of space that surrounds the Sun and extends well beyond the orbit of the outermost planets, including Pluto. It is formed by the solar wind, which is a continuous stream of charged particles (mostly electrons and protons) emitted by the Sun.

### Key Features of the Heliosphere

- **Solar Wind:** The solar wind pushes against the interstellar medium, creating the boundary of the heliosphere. This wind travels at speeds ranging from 300 to 800 kilometers per second.

- **Heliospheric Boundary:** The boundary of the heliosphere is known as the heliopause. It is where the solar wind slows down and merges with the interstellar medium. Beyond this boundary lies the local interstellar medium.

- **Heliosheath:** The region between the termination shock (where the solar wind slows down abruptly) and the heliopause is called the heliosheath. It is characterized by a decrease in the speed of the solar wind and an increase in the density of particles.

- **Magnetic Field:** The heliosphere is also influenced by the Sun's magnetic field, which extends into space and helps shape the heliosphere's structure.

### Importance of the Heliosphere

- **Protection:** The heliosphere acts as a shield, protecting the solar system from harmful cosmic radiation and high-energy particles from outside the solar system.

- **Space Exploration:** Understanding the heliosphere is crucial for space missions and exploring the outer reaches of our solar system, as it affects spacecraft traveling through this region.

- **Astrophysical Research:** Studying the heliosphere helps scientists understand the interactions between the solar wind and the interstellar medium, providing insights into the broader dynamics of our galaxy.
